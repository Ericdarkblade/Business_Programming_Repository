    "1. Use input() to get user input for the current temperature in Fahrenheit. Use a proper prompt so the user knows what you are asking for.\n",
    "1. Convert the user input into a <b>float</b> and save it to a variable named \"fahrenheit\". As long as the user enters a number, the code should work.\n",
    "1. Convert the fahrenheit temperature entered by the user into celsuis temperature and store it in a variable named \"celsuis\". The formula is:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    celsuis = (fahrenheit − 32) × 5/9 </pre>\n",
    "1. Check celsuis for the following conditions and print out corresponding messages\n",
    "   - check if celsuis is less than equal to 0, if so, print out \"Freezing!\"\n",
    "   - check if celsuis is less than equal to 18, if so, print out \"Chilly!\"\n",
    "   - check if celsuis is less than equal to 28, if so, print out \"Comfy!\"\n",
    "   - check if celsuis is less than equal to 35, if so, print out \"Hot!\"\n",
    "   - check if celsuis is less than equal to 18, if so, print out \"sweltering!\"\n",
    "1. Print out the entered Fahrehheit and the converted Celsuis. For example, if the user enters 68, the following should be the output\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Tell me the temperature in Fahrenheit: 68\n",
    "Comfy!\n",
    "Fahrenheit entered: 68.0  celsuis: 20.0\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "1. Another test case is converting 30 in Fahrenheit. The output should be the following. The many digits after the decimal point is fine. **Don't round it.**:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Tell me the temperature in Fahrenheit: 30\n",
    "Freezing!\n",
    "Fahrenheit entered: 30.0  celsuis: -1.1111111111111112\n",
