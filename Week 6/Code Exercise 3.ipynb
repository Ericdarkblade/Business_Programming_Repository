    "## Problem 1: Write a program to calculate sales commission.\n",
    "1. Create a function named **calculate_commission**. This function should:\n",
    "    - Have 2 parameterss: **unit_price** and **num_of_units**. Set 14 as the default value of unit_price. Don't set default value for num_of_units. Use the parameter names **exactly** as indicated.\n",
    "    - Inside the function, calculate the commission using the following business rules (it is easy to implement the following using if, elif, else):\n",
    "        - Up to 40 units sold = 5% commission\n",
    "        - Between 41 and 80 units sold = 6% commission (between ... and includes the boundaries)\n",
    "        - Between 81 and 120 units sold = 7% commission\n",
    "        - More than 120 units sold = 8% commission\n",
    "    - **Return instead of print the calculated commission** (Check the difference between value-returning function and void functions and make sure you return the value as a number.)\n",
    "1. Note that the function can only be called after it is defined. So AFTER the function definition, do the following:\n",
    "    1. Ask user input using input() for number of units sold.\n",
    "    1. convert the input to an integer. Assume the user will behave and enter an integer. **No need to use try/except or while loop in this problem.**\n",
    "    1. Check if the user enters a positive integer, if not, print out the following message \"Please enter a positive integer\" to the user and **terminate** the program.\n",
    "1. If the user input is correct, call the function calculation_commission() twice using the user entered units sold in the following way:\n",
    "    1. Pass in the user entered units sold, use the default price to calculate the commission. \n",
    "    1. Pass in the user entered units sold and a price of 15 to calculate the commission. \n",
    "1. Print out the unit sold, unit price, and calculated commission for each calculation. See the following output examples for the exact messages your program should produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test your code:**\n",
    "1. Run the code, when I enter -100, the program output should be:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Please enter units sold: -100\n",
    "Please enter a positive integer.\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "1. Run the code again, when I enter 30, the program output should be:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Please enter units sold: 30\n",
    "For unit sold 30 and unit price $14 the commission is 21.0\n",
    "For unit sold 30 and unit price $15 the commission is 22.5</pre>\n",
    "1. Run the code, when I enter 80, the program output should be:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Please enter units sold: 80\n",
    "For unit sold 80 and unit price $14 the commission is 67.2\n",
    "For unit sold 80 and unit price $15 the commission is 72.0\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "1. Try enter 40, 45, 81, 100, 120, 150 and make sure the outputs are all correct. Note that I specifically test values 40, 81, 120. These are called boundary conditions and are easy to have bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The hard part of this problem is to know what should be done inside the function and what should be done outside the function. The comments in the code cell should help**"
